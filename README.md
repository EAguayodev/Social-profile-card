## Initialization
I began my project by initializing a Git repository, setting a solid foundation for version control and collaborative development.

## Building the Profile Card
With the repository set up, my next step was to design and build the profile card. I employed HTML5 for the structure, ensuring semantic clarity and accessibility. For styling, CSS3 was my choice, allowing me to create a visually appealing and responsive design.

## Desktop to Mobile Workflow
My development approach was desktop-first; I ensured that the layout and functionalities were fully optimized for larger screens. Once satisfied with the desktop version, I transitioned to refining the design for mobile devices, emphasizing responsiveness and a seamless user experience across various screen sizes.

This structured approach highlights my methodical process in creating a cross-platform compatible social profile card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned to use html and css to create a social profile links similar to building a linktree account.
